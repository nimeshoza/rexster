Rexster is a multi-faceted graph server with direct support for searching, "ranking":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking, scoring, and more specifically, "recommendation":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system. Rexster is generally communicated with over "HTTP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol, but also has the beginnings of a binary protocol which currently has support through [[Rexster Console]]. Requests trigger stored traversals that are identified by "URIs":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier and are parametrized by the "query parameter component":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme of the URI. Rexster primarily responds to requests with results represented as "JSON":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON documents. Rexster is highly extensible through [[Rexster Extensions | Extensions]] making it possible to expose new kinds of functionality within its container. The general system architecture is diagrammed below.

Rexster makes extensive use of "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com. Blueprints, amongst other things, is a collection of graph-based interfaces (e.g. graph, vertex, edge, etc.) and their implementations (e.g. "Neo4j":http://www.neo4j.org, "OpenRDF":http://www.openrdf.org, etc.). The benefit is that Rexster can be used with various graph backends by providing "plug and play" support. Two useful "TinkerPop":http://www.tinkerpop.com products that make use of Blueprints are

  * "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com is a general-purpose, graph-based programming language
  * "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com is a data processing framework that has support for processing Blueprints-based graphs.
