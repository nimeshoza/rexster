This cheat sheet provides a review of the RESTful API for Rexster. Note that beyond the query parameters provided in the table below, the standard Rexster parameters @rexster.offset.start@, @rexster.offset.end@, and @rexster.returnKeys@ also work in cases where it makes sense. The @<graph>@ is the unique name of a graph configured within Rexster. The base of the URI, when running locally, is generally @localhost:8182@.

Please note that there are [[Rexster MIME Types]] that affect operations within the API.

^1^ Only applies to @SailGraph@ configurations.
^2^ Underlying graph database implementations must support the ability to assign the edge/vertex identifier.  In cases where the graph database does not support the identifier (ie. Neo4j), the identifier supplied with be ignored and the graph assigned identifier will be returned in the JSON after successful graph element creation.

In all cases, parameters may be POSTed or PUTed on the [[URI|Mapping a URI to JSON]] or as JSON using one of the [[Rexster MIME Types]].

h1. Rexster Parameters

* @rexster.offset.start@ - Expects a numeric value that represents the start point for returning a set of records and is used in conjunction with @rexster.offset.end@ to allow for paging of results.  If used without a valid @rexster.offset.end@ parameter specified, Rexster will return all remaining records in the set.    
* @rexster.offset.end@ - Expects a numeric value that represents the end point for returning a set of records and is used in conjunction with @rexster.offset.start@ to allow for paging of results.  If used without a valid @rexster.offset.start@ parameter specified, Rexster will assume the start value to be zero.
* @rexster.returnKeys@ - Expects a comma separated list of property names to return in the results.  Element meta-data will always be returned even if @rexster.returnKeys@ are specified.  If a valid value for this parameter is not specified, then all properties are returned.
